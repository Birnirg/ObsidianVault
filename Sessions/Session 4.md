In the Letters Darwin fins correspondence between Voz and Scarlet Triad, The Scarlet Triad promises to give her support/money and power to start her own assassin guild/nation and necromancy laboratory in Alterain citadel. the Scarlet triad wanted to support this endeavour if she found the Alsettas rings and activated all those she found.

In the research notes it is indicated that one of the Alsettas rings cave system at Guardinans Way, and to activate it you need to press a symbol and inject some magical energies.

We decide to go back to Breachhill to deliver Voz to Greta Gardenia, leader of the city council, so she can question her. As Willow tries to pickup Voz she tries to bite, so we decide to gag her. 

Greta offers us 10g to go find the Alsettas rings.

We go to the Cadens keg, to drink. We had a big discussion on why we are here to become Heroes, and the morality of decions. A drinking game between Willow, Gommel and Cerris. Darwin stopped after one and spent some time to learn new spells. 

After a day of rest, we go back to the Guardians way Caves.

After going down into the caves we stumble upon a weave ridden path where we meet Renalia who looks like a druid that controls spiders. After she makes sure we have no ill intentions we invited us to follow her further down into the caves. Renalia is from Muwagni jungles, she has a beef with the Cinder clawses. She tells us the cinder claws attacked her clan in the Muwagni jungle and she fled, she doesnt really know how she got here. Darwin offered to try to help get through the Alsettas ring back to the Muwangi jungle.

Renalia offered to guide us to the place where the Cinder Claws where. she helps us sneak up behind some Cinder Claws, and get a suprise attack against them. A fight ensues. We barely survive the fight and loot the Cinder claws. finding 

 5 x Cinderclaw Gauntlet worth 150g each.
